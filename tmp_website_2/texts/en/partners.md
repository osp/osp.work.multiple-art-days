A national center for contemporary art dedicated to published works , the Cneai – Centre national édition art image – has, since 1997, developed a model for collaborative programming: organizing research groups and editorial programs (a catalogue of 600 multiples and 150 publications), exhibitions and events, including research (laboratories and seminars) and mediation. The artists and contributors are offered residencies at the “Maison flottante,” conceived by the Bouroullec brothers in 2007. The FMRA collection, which is open to the public, brings together 12,000 books and artistic ephemera. The Cneai dynamically combines the artistic fields that define the various frontiers of visual experience, merging sound art, performance, choreography, graphic design, and literature and scientific research.

Founded by Antoine de Galbert, a private art collector and prominent figure on the French contemporary art scene, the maison rouge was inaugurated in Paris in June 2004. Its goal is to promote various facets of contemporary creation through a program of temporary exhibitions. More than 1,300 square meters of exhibition space are given over to independent curators, invited by the maison rouge to explore the diverse range of contemporary artistic experimentation, often by way of important private collections from around the world. By inciting and initiating various artistic experiences, the foundation aims to encourage the multiplicity of practices and approaches to contemporary creation.
