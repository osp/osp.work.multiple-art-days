####The new fair for limited art editions

A new, annual fair revolving around publishing, MAD will present, for 3 days, a wide spectrum of contemporary publishing practices, from zines to rare objects: prints, multiples, artistsâ€™ books, videos, audio CDs, vinyls...

Held at the Maison Rouge / Foundation Antoine de Galbert on May 22, 23, and 24, 2015, MAD is a new fair for anyone who wants to collect contemporary art editions in their many different forms.

Taking over the entire space of the Maison Rouge, a Parisian institution dedicated to contemporary creation, MAD will bring together some 70 international publishers, whose common goal is quality of their offerings.

Much more than a fair, MAD revolves around the figure of the publisher, the most independent and versatile actor in today's art world.

There will also be 3 days of performances, concerts, signatures and discussions on editorial trends in contemporary art. 3 days with artists, writers, researchers, art and book dealers, publishers, collectors from around the world.

We look forward to welcoming you!!
