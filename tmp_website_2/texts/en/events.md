####Events

Accompanying the 3 MAD days, MAD IN presents 3 days of conversations, performances, dialogues, concerts and signatures, taking place both in the auditorium of the maison rouge and scattered throughout the fair.

Three special curated booths will also be on display: Mathieu Mercier brings together self-published, “equitable” multiples by selected artists; Pierre Ponant & Christophe Jacquet invite 10 artists and designers to show graphic works; Jean-Max Colard & Antoine Dufeu present a selection of books on literature and the art of exhibitions.
